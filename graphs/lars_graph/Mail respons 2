Hello, I am writing my bachelor thesis about data extraction from tree graphs at Stockholm University. I have found 3 papers with Elsevier Copyright which contains in total 6 figures I would like to use as example when testing the performance of the algorithm, this is for non-commercial purposes and my supervisor is Lars Arvestad which is one of the authors to two of the papers.

The first papers is "Phylogenetic relationships of the Fox (Forkhead) gene family in the Bilateria" doi:10.1016/S0378-1119(03)00741-8
from which I need access to figure 1 and 2.

The second paper is "IdentiÔ¨Åcation of the cellulose synthase genes from the Oomycete Saprolegnia monoica and effect of cellulose synthesis inhibitors on gene expression and enzyme activity" doi:10.1016/j.fgb.2009.07.001
from which I need figure 2.

"Diversity and evolution of chitin synthases in oomycetes (Straminipila:Oomycota)" https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2019.106558
from which I need access to figure 1 and table 3.

If possible I would like to be able to performe minor modifications such as croping the image to view a smaller part of the image.
