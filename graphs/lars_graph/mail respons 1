Hello.
I am writing my Bachelor thesis about data extraction and found a figure in a paper I would like to use.

The paper is called "MAP20, a Microtubule-Associated Protein in the Secondary Cell Walls of Hybrid Aspen, Is a Target of the Cellulose Synthesis Inhibitor 2,6-Dichlorobenzonitrile" and was published in Plant Physiology, November 2008, Vol. 148, pp. 1283–1294.

I am interested in displaying figure 3 of the paper in my thesis as an example of a graph for extracting the hierarchical structure. Is this acceptable if I give citation?
