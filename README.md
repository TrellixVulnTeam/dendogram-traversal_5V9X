Dendogram Traversal

This repository contains the code for my bachelor thesis involving traversal of dendograms.

Thining Algorithm is based on "Efficient Binary Image Thinning, Using Neighborhood Maps" by Joseph M. Cychosz (1994).
Tree Traversal is based on "Structural Graph Extraction from Images" by Javier Gallego et al. (2012)

================================

To get started with the code, in main.py use the run() function with its parameters.
This first calls the thinning algorithm in thining_algorithm.py.
Then calls functions in graph_finder.py

To generate binary trees in Newick code, you find these in graph_generation.py.
In this file, treePlotter() lets you plot any newick code but depending on the parameter "internalNodesHasNames", the internal names are required or forbidden.
Large sets of binary trees can be generated by generateAllGraphs() and generateXRandomTrees(), the output is Newick code.


======================

Installed packages is Python, Pillow (fork of PIL), Numpy,

Requisite packages to be installed are these but there may be more.
ETE3, Numpy, numpy.ma

ETE3 may require these to be installed:
