This repository contains the code for my bachelor thesis involving traversal of dendograms.

Thining Algorithm is based on "Efficient Binary Image Thinning, Using Neighborhood Maps" by Joseph M. Cychosz (1994).
Tree Traversal is based on "Structural Graph Extraction from Images" by Javier Gallego et al. (2012)
